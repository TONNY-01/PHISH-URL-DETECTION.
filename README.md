# PHISH-URL-DETECTION.
# Malicious URL Detection

This project is a machine learning pipeline for detecting malicious URLs. The notebook demonstrates how to load, clean, and preprocess URL data; extract features; train multiple classifiers; and evaluate their performance. While the code is exploratory and unstructured, it provides a detailed walk-through of the methods and metrics used for URL maliciousness detection.

## Overview

Cybersecurity is a critical concern, and detecting malicious URLs plays a key role in preventing phishing and other online threats. In this project, we create a predictive model that distinguishes between benign and malicious URLs using techniques like text vectorization and feature engineering.

## Data

The dataset consists of URLs labeled as "malicious" or "benign". You can use your own dataset or refer to publicly available ones. If a specific dataset is used, include a link or instructions here on how to obtain it.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Read and inspect the dataset of URLs.
   - Identify missing values and outliers.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean URL strings (e.g., removing extraneous characters).
   - Tokenize and vectorize URLs using techniques like TF-IDF.
   - Create additional features such as URL length, number of dots, or special character counts.

3. **Model Training**  
   - Experiment with classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
   - Handle any class imbalance using techniques such as oversampling (SMOTE) or specialized model settings.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Visualize performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
